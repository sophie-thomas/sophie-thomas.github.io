            | kidcrowd is a solution for parents who are fed up with their child receiving unwanted gifts. This website makes giving children's gifts meaningful and sustainable - which will result in children being better with money and a decrease in the 5.1 billion pounds of unwanted gifts that end up in landfill every year.

          p.project-intro
            | Working with the Founder, Melissa, I designed and prototyped the entire website in under 5 days. Using Adobe XD, I crafted a website that provides a consistent, family-friendly feel throughout ready for Melissa to present to potential investors.

            | Prior to starting the project, Melissa and I talked through the requirements of the project and timescales. Due to the date of the investor pitch, this needed to be completed within 5 days. We discussed what pages were needed, the actions the users would need to complete and the direction she wanted the overall feel of the website to go in. 
          
          p 
            | Along with providing the kidcrowd brand guidelines and assets, she also sent over a draft mockup she'd done as a base for me to work from. Using that, I enhanced the design to ensure consistency throughout the pages and the overall site was easy to use and navigate for parents.
